## Boiler - an opinionated Angular 1.x starter
_This had to be done for starting new applications that need testing, and e2e testing_

Following some of the nice provided docs that were served from these two wonderful
repositories. These two projects were the basis for me blending together something to make to
get a Angular application going.
