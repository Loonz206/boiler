##This is an Application Starting Boiler using elements of Ngbp and HTML5 boilerplate
_It had to be made as a starter setup to begin projects_

I know there is probably a million things out there for this stuff but I like this
hybrid with my background doing websites.

Dependencies for the project is
**node.js, gulp, karma, phantom.js, protractor, less**

clone the project and run **npm install**

NOTE: For Windows, run **npm install gulp --global gulp-cli** in addition to npm install. It will install the Command Line Utility for gulp.
